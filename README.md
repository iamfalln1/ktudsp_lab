# KTU ECE DSP MATLAB CODES
This is a Repository for DSP based MATLAB programming. All programs are tested in MathWorks MATLAB or in any other MATLAB alternatives (mostly in octave).
Basic MATLAB programming skills are required for understanding of the underlying programs. 
# SCILAB Update
We have switched to Scilab for the DSP LAB. From now onwards scilab programming will be active in this repositories. MATLAB programming will be added from time to time.
